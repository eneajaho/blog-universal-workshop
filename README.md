# BlogUniversal

### Use case

A simple website, that has a landing, contact, blog, about and dashboard page.

We want to make the site load faster and SEO-friendly.

#### What we know:

- Landing, contact and about page content is static.
- Blog / Single post pages have dynamic content that comes from backend.
- Site title doesn't change when we navigate through it.
- Dashboard page doesn't need SEO, because will be behind a login page, that crawlers cannot pass.

### Todo

- ~~Add server side rendering~~
- ~~Add static site generation~~
- ~~Fix localStorage problem when server side rendering the app~~
- ~~Add SEO service~~
- ~~Compare page speed between CSR, SSR and SSG versions~~
- ~~Don't server side render dashboard page~~
